# Emergency Alert System for Visually Impaired and Loss of Hearing People

[![Published in IEEE](https://img.shields.io/badge/IEEE-Published-blue)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10962765)

## Overview

This project presents a low-cost, wireless **Emergency Alert System** tailored for visually and hearing-impaired individuals using **ESP32 microcontrollers** and the **ESP-NOW protocol**. Designed for immediate response, it delivers alerts via **vibration** (for the visually impaired) and **buzzer** (for the hearing impaired), triggered through a simple push-button interface.

This project was successfully published in the **IEEE Xplore Digital Library** at the 2024 ICICCS Conference.

## Key Features

- One-button emergency alert activation
- Wireless communication using ESP-NOW (peer-to-peer, no Wi-Fi needed)
- Dual-alert mechanism:
  - Vibration for visually impaired users
  - Buzzer for hearing impaired users
- MAC address scanning for dynamic pairing
- Compact and cost-effective hardware design

## Technologies Used

- ESP32 Microcontroller
- Arduino IDE
- ESP-NOW Protocol
- Buzzer
- Vibration Motor
- Push Button
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires

## How It Works

1. **MAC Address Setup**: Use `MAC_CODE.ino` to get each ESP32â€™s MAC address.
2. **Transmitter (TX)**:
   - Waits for button press
   - Sends alert wirelessly using ESP-NOW
3. **Receiver (RX)**:
   - Receives signal
   - Triggers both buzzer and vibration motor

## Applications

- Smart alert systems in public spaces
- Personal emergency devices for the differently-abled
- School/college/home safety assist systems
